NAME
        route - a library for pattern matching and dispatching http requests

DESCRIPTION
	Route is a library of data types and combinators for matching
        http requests. The matching mechanism allows the library to 
        build dispatch/routing tables for web applications.

USAGE
	The library is pretty straight forward to use. Simply:
          . import io.mth.route._
          . build a route using the combinators available
          . evaluate routes for each request

        A simple example:

          import io.mth.route._

          val route = 
            ("book" <%> stringtoken).route(book =>  // match urls with 2 framents starting with book
              Get(getbook(book)) |                  // for those urls, dispatch to getbook when the method is Get
              Put(createbook(book))                 // for those urls, dispatch to createbook when the method is Put
            ) | ("people" </> "authors").route(     // otherwise if the url is exactly people/authors
              Get(listauthors)                      // and the method is get dispatch to listauthors
            )

          val req = request(Get, "book" </> "1984", text.html)
 
          val res = route(req)
 
STATE
        The `route` library has a stable scala API for version 1.0.

LIMITATIONS
        Currently there are three missing features planned for 
        version 2.0:
          1. A clean java API.
          2. Combinators for routing multiple matchers to one target.
          3. Better access to request including headers and query
             parameters.
